<h3>Time well spent</h3>
Our lives can be broken down into a series of actions. These actions can largely be split into proportions of two large categories.

1. Survival
2. Entertainment

A _survival_ action is one that you perform to live
An _entertainment_ action is one that you are doing when you are not trying to survive 

Living in a society that is built on trade means that in order to survive you need to generate value. This value is then traded for money which may be traded again to buy goods and services. 

The case where people need to work for others to make moneyoften arises. This is usually coupled with no out of work value creation. Typically people take this route because:
 
They do not know how to create value
They are not willing to try new things
of the security that comes with a decent pay cheque
They need the money for survival and have dependants that take up their time
They are oddly not interested in changing their position or experiencing new things in their life
